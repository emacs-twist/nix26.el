* nix26.el
=nix26.el= is an Emacs interface to experimental commands of Nix.
Its goal is to enable the user to easily work across multiple Nix projects.
A typical use case is one main program that contains a =flake.nix= and its dependencies in separate repositories which may be or may not be flakes.
It is also intended to provide a common infrastructure for [[https://github.com/emacs-twist/twist.el][twist.el]].
